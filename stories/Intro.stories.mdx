# Storybook DocsPage

When you install [Storybook Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storybookjs/storybook/next/addons/docs/README.md), `DocsPage` is the zero-config default documentation that all stories get out of the box. It aggregates your stories, text descriptions, docgen comments, props tables, and code examples into a single page for each component.

- [More resources](#more-resources)

## Motivation

`DocsPage` is the successor to [`addon-info`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/info), which was one of the most popular Storybook addons despite many limitations.

Like `addon-info`, `DocsPage` provides sensible defaults, meaning it adds documentation to your existing Storybook without requiring any additional work on your part.

However, `DocsPage` brings the following improvements:

- It supports all frameworks that Storybook supports, including React, Vue, Angular and [many others](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storybookjs/storybook/next/addons/docs/README.md#framework-support).
- It generates better documentation that can be used as a standalone docs site, independently of Storybook.
- It supports better configuration, so you can capture project specific information with ease.
- It's built to work with [`MDX`](./mdx.md`) when you need more control of your documentation.
